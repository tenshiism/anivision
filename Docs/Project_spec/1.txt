the app is called ani vision (animal vision because it identifies species with scientific names)
Make an app that uses openai API (defined in app with API URL and API KEY) to scan images and tell the user the scientific name of the species in the image
Make a plan for handling over long AI output
plan out these and more features before creating an app
use sub agents to complete the tasks and allow them to call in outside help
you may use and install any MCP server you need to complete this task, have your sub agents set it up for you and move forward weather they are able to do it or not
when the user opens the app they will see a welcome screen with a popout drwaer with settings
Images will be stored on device and will be named as the main species in the picture
once they open the picture other details will be there
including a 1 sentence ai summary 
a button to scan the picture again
create folder
