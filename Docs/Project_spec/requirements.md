Requirements:
1. The app identifies species from images using OpenAI Vision API, providing scientific names
2. Welcome screen with a slide-out drawer for settings
3. Settings must include OpenAI API URL and API KEY configuration
4. Images stored locally on device, named after the main species identified
5. Image detail view showing:
   - One sentence AI summary
   - Scientific and common names
   - Re-scan button
   - Additional species details
6. Handle over-long AI outputs gracefully

Create a comprehensive architecture document covering:
- Overall system architecture and technology stack (recommend a cross-platform solution)
- Detailed component structure
- Data flow and state management
- API integration strategy including error handling for long responses
- Image storage and management approach
- UI/UX flow diagrams
- File structure organization
- Required dependencies and libraries
- Implementation phases and priorities
- Strategy for handling edge cases (no species found, multiple species, poor image quality)

Please create detailed markdown documentation in /docs/architecture/ covering all these aspects. Focus on creating a production-ready, scalable design that can be implemented efficiently.

Complete ONLY this architecture and planning task, then use attempt_completion to report the comprehensive plan.Design and plan the AniVision application - an animal species identification app using OpenAI API.
