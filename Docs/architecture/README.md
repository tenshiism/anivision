## Quick Start
This architecture is designed for implementation using React Native with TypeScript, providing cross-platform support for iOS and Android while maintaining a single codebase.

## Key Design Decisions

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: React Native with TypeScript
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit with Redux Persist
- **Navigation**: React Navigation v6
- **Image Processing**: React Native Image Picker & React Native Fast Image
- **Storage**: AsyncStorage for settings, React Native FS for images
- **API Client**: Axios with retry logic
- **UI Components**: React Native Elements with custom theming

### Architecture Pattern
- **MVVM** (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern with React hooks
- **Repository Pattern** for data access layer
- **Service-Oriented Architecture** for API interactions
- **Component-Based UI** with atomic design principles

## Core Features
1. Species identification using OpenAI Vision API
2. Local image storage with intelligent naming
3. Folder organization with AI-powered grouping
4. Offline capability with cached results
5. Settings management for API configuration
6. Re-scan functionality for improved accuracy

## Next Steps
Review each documentation file in order to understand the complete architecture before beginning implementation.
